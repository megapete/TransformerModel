/// A concrete class of PCH_CoilSection with PCH_WdgDisk as the basic building block. Note that within a section, all disks and interdisk insulation are identical. However, also note that while disks are physically identical, they may contain taps (ie: some may be PCH_WdgTappedDisks). The correct way to use this class is to initialize it with all regular disks, then set certain disks to have taps.

        The radial spacer definition used in the coil section. This is defined as an array to allow multiple radial spacers to be used to yield a given thickness.

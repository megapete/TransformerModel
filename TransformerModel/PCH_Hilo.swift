        * The totalRadialBuild must be designed to allow for a 6mm final duct (to allow for disk windings). That is, for a hilo with only a single tube of say, 2.5mm, the totalRadialBuild must be exactly equal to 8.5mm. If it is not, the innermost tube thickness will be increased to a maximum of 3.5mm. If that limit is reached, then the innerDiameter will be adjusted so that a final duct of 6mm will result.
    
        * The innermost tube thickness will be adjusted (if necessary) so that it has a minimum thickness of 2.5mm (to give it some rigidity for winding).
    
        * The outermost duct will be adjusted to have a thickness of 6mm to allow for a standard dovetail strip.
    
        * Tube thicknesses will be rounded to the nearest 0.5mm.
    
        * After returning, the calling routine should check the innerDiameter property of the returned hilo - it may be different than what was originally passed in.

        - parameter totalRadialBuild: The total radial build of the hilo, from innerDiameter to the outside of the outermost duct strips
        - parameter totalSolid: The sum of all the radial builds of the tubes in the hilo. This routine will take care of splitting up the solids.
        - parameter numColumns: The number of strips in the oil ducts of the hilo
    
        - returns: A fully defined hilo. The calling routine should check the innerDiameter property of the returned hilo - it may be different than what was originally passed in.

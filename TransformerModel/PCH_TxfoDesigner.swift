// This is the entry point for the transformer designing program. The idea is that this function will take care of finding a suitable (and cheapest) design for the set of terminals passed in, then return that transformer to the calling routine. It is assumed that the forTerminals parameter has been sorted so that the lowest "main" voltage is at index 0.

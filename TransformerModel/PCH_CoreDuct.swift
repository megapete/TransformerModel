/// A core duct is defined as a subclass of PCH_CoreStep to make things easier. They usually use duct strips of 5mm thick. For now, it is only possible to create this "standard" duct. Note that while this definition can be used as the basis for specifying the duct material to purchase, it should not be used directly to do so (ie: use the ductstrip defined as a property herein to create a new ductstrip(s) for specification purposes).
